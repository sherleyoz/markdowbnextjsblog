### MUNDA ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM

* The Mundas consider village as a political unit. It had a head and an organization to deal with other villages.
* The head of the Munda village was called the Pahan (priest). He obtained this title by virtue of being the original founder of a new community or the oldest representative of the original founder.
* His duty was to offer sacrifice at festivals mainly for three reasons:
* To preserve the village against the ravages of wild animals;
* To obtain satisfactory harvest;
* To ensure successful hunts.
* The chief functions of the Pahan were:
* To preside over the Panchayat;
* To punish those who violated established customs;
* To collect the contributions of the village and hand them over to the proper authority.
* The Pahan began to exercise the above functions with the introduction of the Raja into the Munda political system. Later on, he was assisted by a Munda in the execution of his duties. These two offices were solely for service without any remuneration or special grant of land attached to it. The two officials were highly respected.
* Confederation of villages
* The Confederation of villages was made up of 10 or 12 villages, called a Patti. The chief of the patti was called the Manki. He was the political organizer of the Mundas.
* His duties were:
* To settle disputes concerning land and other matters;
* To settle questions of exceptional tribal interest within a village;
* To settle peace between different villages with the help of a council of elders;
* To collect chanda or rent and hand over it to the Raja.

### PARHA ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM (ORAON TRIBE)

* In the traditional Oraon society the largest political unit is the tribe. A tribe is divided into a number of territorial segments known an Parha. These are divided into number of villages, which constitute the smallest political units. Each clan is associated with one Parha (a tribal section) in which it constitutes the aristocratic nucleus.
* There are two type of village head in an Oraon village:
* **secular head** known as **mahato** who act on social issue;
* **religious** head known as **pahan** who looks into religious matters.
* The village elects the **mahato** once every **three years**. He presides over the village council. The inter village organisation of the regional panchayat is known as PARHA. The head of the pahara is called Parha Raja.
* The no of villages in different parha organisation very from region to region. A Parha comprises a number of villages. The number of villages, however, varies from Parha to Parha. It may consist of seven, nine etc and generally they are called by numbers.
* In a Parha all the villages are subject to the authority of the Parha Panchayat.
* One of the villages in a Parha is called the Raja (king) village, another the Dewan (Prime minister) village, a third the Panrey (clerk of the village), a fourth the Kotwar (orderly) village, and the remaining villagers are the Praja (subject).
* **The Raja village is the head village of the Parha** , and the headman of the village presides at the meetings of the Parha Panchayat. Generally, the Mahto (Headman) acts as the Kartaha (Chairman) and in his absence the Pahan (religious head) or any elderly bhuindar of the Raja village may be chosen to officiate as Kartaha (Chairman) of the Parha council
* The Parha Panchayat decides cases of infringement of certain taboos that affect the whole Parha or the tribe, for instance sexual union between Oraon and non-Oraon, and any case of Incest. The settle disputes regarding precedence at the Jatra festivals, the right to game, and so forth, other matters which the village Panchayat cannot decide or in which their decision is not accepted are brought before the Parha council.
* Parha Panchayat has the right to excommunicate an Oraon for sexual intercourse with a non-Oraon or having eaten cooked food at the hands of a non-Oraon. It is believed that the breach of these taboos will affect good fortune of the Parha and is the main concern of the Parha council.
* It was in the seventies that Bhikhna Bhagat revived this declining institution of the Oraon. A vigorous movement was launched and the Sarna Oraon mobilised themselves under the banner of their respective Parha.

# Oraons

* Among the Oraons the word Bhuinhari means owner of the land. The Bhuinhars are the descendants of the pioneer families who cleared the jungle and brought that particular area under cultivation and became owners. The Bhuinhar khunt (maximal lineage) comprises two segments, the Pahan khunt and the Mahto khunt.
* In the original Bhuinhar family authority was vested in the original founder or the eldest member of the lineage. He was known as the Pahan and was both the ritual and the secular head. In the exercise of his secular duties, he was assisted by another member of the lineage called Mahto.
* In time the descendants of these two officials came to be regarded as belonging to the Pahan khunt nucleus of the maximal lineage in a Bhuinhari village.
* Authority in the Bhuinhari lineage comprises of two offices: - the Pahan or Baigas (the village priest) and the Mahto (secular head). The authority of the Pahan and the Mahto is derived from their spiritual status and from their seniority in the hierarchy of lineage elders.
* The Pahan belongs to the Pahan khunt and the Mahto belongs to the Mahto khunt. Great prestige and respect is attached to the status of the Pahan and Mahto and to avoid dispute these officers are selected triennially or in a few instances at a longer interval by the magic sup (winnowing basket).
* It is believed that the selection of these officers rests in supernatural hands, so that the headship is selected through a ritual process and is believed to have a spiritual backing. A bachelor cannot be a Pahan.
* The function of the Pahan is primarily religious. It Is believed that he has a sacred association with the earth and the ancestors which give him ritual power.
* The Mahto is the secular head of the village elders. Usually, the most influential person among the lineage heads is elected as Mahto.
* The Mahto leadership is an ancestral heritage and hence a person elected must belong to the Mahto khunt.
* He is responsible for the protection of the village community from external threats and hence his duty is to maintain satisfactory relationship with the outside world.
* He is the chief organizer of all important public work in the village He must be Informed of all the important affairs that concern the whole lineage and the village community in general.

### MANJHI ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM (SANTHALS)

* The political organization and administrative unit of the Santals village are mostly governed by councils of elders who regulate the life of the people within the village and the order of the village outside world.
* The political organization and administrative is generally democratic in nature. The Santals govern by their own laws and have their own method of treating different kinds of offences.
* The offices of the political organization were generally hereditary and passed patrilineally but now days the offices are not only hereditary but are conferred by selection of person. These officials are responsible to the community for their functions.
* The Santals have a well-established political organization.
* It functions at the village, inter-village (pirh or pargana) and regional (disam) levels.
* The village is considered as the smallest and most important unit at the ground level. There is a traditional village council (atu mone hor) constituted of functionaries like Manjhi (secular village headman), Jog Manjhi (deputy village headman), Parmanik, (assistant to village headman), Gadet (secretary to village headman 7 messenger), Jog Parmanik (Deputy Parmanik), Naike (village head priest) and Kudam Naike (assistant to village priest).
* All the household heads are the members of the village council. Manjhi presides over the village council meetings and settles all the disputes relating to theft, conflict, divorce, partition of property, adoption of children, quarrels over land, violation of social customs, tradition, etc. at the village level. The meeting of the council generally takes place at the **manjhi than**.
* These officials have to perform their functions in accordance with the tribal system and that is why they are expected to be well acquainted with the Santal traditions, customs, religious beliefs and practices. These traits are still prevalent in the village, where the community live.
* The inter-village council known as the pirh or pargana constituted of fifty to sixty villages, deals with matters which cannot be settled at the village level. It is constituted by the representatives of several villages under the pirh or pargana. Pir Pargana is the **secular head of the pir** , nominated by all the Manjhis of the component villages once in **every five years**.
* Along with Pir Pargana, Pir Dihiri and Pir Gadet are also two important functionaries at pir level administration. Major offences like incest, adultery and inter-village disputes are discussed and decided at this level. When somebody is dissatisfied with the decision of the village council, he may appeal to the pirh or pargana council.
* It also functions as the hunt council. The annual hunt is organized by a large number of Santals from different villages beyond the pirh or pargana, which gives them a chance to meet and discuss complicated disputes. Hunting expeditions may continue for three or four days. Spending the whole day in the chase, the hunting party takes a rest at one place overnight where they discuss different problems. Any case previously referred to the village or pargana council may be placed before the hunt council for a fresh trial. Excommunication from the community or bitlaha for grave offences can be awarded by the hunt council. Guilty persons are fined by the council and the fine is spent on feasting.
* **Five to ten Pirs together constitute a Disham** , whose secular head is **Desh Pargana**. He is elected by the Pir Parganas once in **every five years**. He settles disputes on the cases which are not decided at the Pir level with the consultation of Pir Parganas and Manjhis. In case of serious social offence (bitlaha), Desh Pargana is vested with powers to impose both physical and financial punishment to the guilty person considering the severity of the offence. Sometimes, the culprit is excommunicated from the society. Disam Dihiri and Disham Gadet also help Desh Pargana in this work for smooth administration at Disham level.

### MUNDA MANKI SYSTEM- HO AND MUNDARI

* The Munda Manki System normally three level organised were prevalent:
* first level organisation in the lineage level
* second at the village level and
* third at the in the inter village level.
* However, in some areas inter village organisation are weak in Ho area. Munda are the head men of the village and are subject to the authority of mankies, who are the head of inter village panchayats (known as pirs)
* The post of Munda is hereditary.
* Some of the pirs are large so these are divided into a number of subdivisions, each presided over by a manki. The British vested the mundas with the power of collecting revenue taxes.
* At the lineage level, the elder or the lineage head leads the own lineage people.
* Munda is the village head.
* There are two types of inter village organization:

Parha - political organization ( **based on clan** )

Patti - social organization ( **based on territory** )

* The Khuntkhatti area is a divided into circles called Pattis.
* A patti is a group of villages generally at least ten or twelve.
* The **head of patti** is called Manki.
* The patti organisation is again of two types, Bhuinhari patties and khuntkhatti patties.
* While patti organisation is territorial, parha is based chiefly on the killi i.e., clan.
* The patti organisation has jurisdiction on every individual falling under its territorial jurisdiction whatever be his or her clan, while parha has jurisdiction over every individual of the clan no matter where he be territorially.
* Thus, there is inherent contradiction in this system an individual will have two heads, one **clan head, parha** and one **Manki, patti head**.

### Dhoklo- Sohor administrative system

* This administrative system is practiced by Kharia tribe. Similar to "Ho" tribe Kharia is also a sub-tribe of Munda society and this administrative system has certain elements of Munda administrative system.
* **Dhoklo** basically means "meeting" and **Sohor** means "President of meeting".
* Kharia tribe is of three types namely Doodh Kharia, Dhelki Kharia and Pahari Kharia or Shabar Kharia, the administrative system of all these is more or less similar in nature with little differences.
* In 1934-35 Kharia tribe organized a pan India General assembly which was called as Dhoklo and the general assembly supported the Caste system and opposed the Panchayati raj .
* Key Posts and Organizations of Dhoklo-Sohor administrative system:
* MAHTO: Mahto is the head of the village and this post is hereditary in nature. However Mahto can be replaced with the consent of village people. (Note: Pahari Kharia village chief is called Dandiya and religious head is called Dihuri and Dihuri assisted Dandiya also besides handling all the religious affairs)
* KARTAHA: This is a very important post and given only to the most honorable, Honest, intellectual person of the village , this is not a salaried post neither hereditary in nature. The selection of Kartaha is done by 20-25 villagers from the panchayat member and he is responsible for solving issues of villages . Every Kartaha of his village sends the information of the activities of villages to Sohor and he can be removed from his post in case of any violation of the code.
* KHUT: This is a regional administrative mechanism formed for inter-village disputes
* KHARIA GHAT: Any Kartaha can be appointed as chief of Khut and this post is called as Kharia Ghat.
* DHOKLO: The General assembly of entire Kharia Society is called as Dhoklo. This assembly is organized on Yearly Basis and every higher officials like Mahto, Pahan , Kartaha are present in this assembly. The Dhoklo Sohor(King) is appointed every three years in this assembly itself
* DHOKLO SOHOR: The chief of Dhoklo is the king of entire Kharia Society which is elected by the people . Major cases are judged by the Sohor with the aid of his ministers.
* LIKHAKAR: He is the minister or secretary of the king and aids the king in social, political and administrative works.
* TINJAUKAR: He is the Finance minister or cashier of the king and maintains ledgers.
* PAHAN/KALO: He is the religious head of the village. He recieves Pahnai Land from the villages , however this post is hereditary in nature but Pahan can be removed in case of violation of Code with the consent of villages
