---
Jharkhand was covered with dense forest in pre-history period. But it was not isolated from the outside world.  It seems that the Kaimur and the Vindhya Mountains saved it from foreign invasions.

* The most primitive tribes of Jharkhand were the Kharias, Birhors and Asurs .The Mundas, Oraons and Hos came after them. The Korba tribes came to this area in between them. Others like The Cheros, the Kgarwar, the Bhumij and the Santhal entered subsequently. The Kharias and Birhors probably come to Jharkhand from other places. The Kharias lived from Rohtas to Patliputra in   ancient period.
* It is apparent that most of the tribes of Jharkhand expect the Cheros, the Kharwars and the santhals had settled in Jharkhand before one thousand B.C. 
	* The Mundas and Oraons got settled in Chhota Nagpur area; 
	* the Hos settled in singhbhum and Hazaribagh area;  
	* the Bhumij in Manbhum area; the Oraons in  Palamu area and 
	* the Birjias also settled in palamu itself. 
	* The Santhals became established in pre – Mughal period and similarly the Cheros – Kharwar enter in Palamu around the same time.
      
# Prehistoric era

- Stone tools and Microliths have been discovered from Chota Nagpur Plateau region which are from Mesolithic and Neolithic period.
  - There are **ancient Cave Paintings in Isko, Hazaribagh district** which are from Meso-chalcolithic period (9,000–5,000 BC).
  - There is a **group of megaliths found close to Barkagaon** that is about 25 km from **Hazaribagh** at Punkri Barwadih, which has been proven to date back to beyond 3000 BCE.
- There are several Cooper tools found in Chota Nagpur Plateau which are from 2nd millennium BCE. These Copper finds known as Copper Hoard Culture.
  - In **Kabra-Kala mound at the confluence of Son and North Koel river in Palamu district** various antiquities and art objects have found which are from Neolithic to Medieval period and the pot-sherds of Redware, black and red ware, black ware, black slipped ware and NBP ware are from Chalcolithic to late medieval period.

# Iron age (c. 1800 – c. 200 BCE)

- **Barudih in the Singhbhum district** of Jharkhand, **yielded evidence of microliths** , Neolithic celts, iron slags, wheel made pottery, and iron objects include a sickle. The earliest radio carbon dating give a range of 1401–837 BCE for this site.
- Around c. 1200–1000 BCE, Vedic Aryans spread eastward to the fertile western Ganges Plain and adopted iron tools which allowed for clearing of forest and the adoption of a more settled, agricultural way of life. During this time, the central Ganges Plain was dominated by a related but non-Vedic Indo-Aryan culture.
- The end of the Vedic period witnessed the rise of cities and large states (called mahajanapadas) as well as sramaṇa movements (including Jainism and Buddhism) which challenged the Vedic orthodoxy. According to Bronkhorst, the Sramana culture arose in "greater Magadha," which was Indo-European, but not Vedic. In this culture, Kshatriyas were placed higher than Brahmins, and it rejected Vedic authority and rituals. In those days the Jharkhand state was a part of Magadha and Anga.
- In Mauryan period, this region was ruled by a number of states, which were collectively known as the **Atavika (forest) states**. These states accepted the suzerainty of the Maurya Empire during Ashoka's reign.

# Classical to medieval periods (c. 200 BCE – c. 1200 CE)

- Samudragupta, while marching through the present-day Chota Nagpur region, directed the first attack against the kingdom of Dakshina Kosala in the Mahanadi valley.
- In the 7th century, Chinese traveler **Xuanzang** passed through the region. He **described the kingdom as Karnasuvarna and Shashanka as its ruler**. To the north of the kingdom was Magadha, Champa was in East, Mahendra in the west and Orissa in the south. The region was also part of Pala Empire.

# Ancient dynasties of Jharkhand

_ **Munda Kingdom** _

- In Chhotanagpur the credit for establishing a state goes to **Risa Munda** who was the first tribal leader of the Mundas.
  - He selected **Sutna Pahan** as the ruler of the Mundas and named the new state as " **Sutia Nag Khand**".
  - Sutna Pahan had divided his state into 07 garhs:-

- 1. Lohagarh (present Lohardaga).
- 2. Hazaribagh
- 3. Palungarh (present Palamu)
- 4. Mangarh (present Manbhum)
- 5. Singgarh (present Singbhum)
- 6. Kesalgarh
- 7. Surmug garh (present Surguja).

- These seven garhs were further sub-divided into 21 parganas namely

- Omdanda, Doisa, Khukhra, Surguja, Jaspur, Gangpur, Porhat, Girga, Birua, Lachra, Birna, Sonpur, Belkhadr, Belsing, Tamar, Lohardih, Kharsing, Udaipur, Bonai, Korya, Changmangkar.

- This administration division reveals that the state established by Sutna Pahan extended beyond the present area of Jharkhand. Unfortunately, the rule of Sutana Pahan could not last long and his state disintegrated into small parts.
