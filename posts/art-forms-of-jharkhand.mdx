### Jadopatia Painting
* <div style="text-align: justify"> The word Jadopatia is actually derived from two words — Jado, which is a Santhal word meaning artist, and Patta, meaning scroll. </div> 
* <div style="text-align: justify"> The artists of this form live in Nawasar village of Dumka dist. </div>
* <div style="text-align: justify"> The paintings are generally six to 10 ft in length and eight to 12 inch in width. </div> 
* <div style="text-align: justify"> The painters used to visit houses where someone has died. In the scroll the dead person’s painting was shown without pupil in the eyes and the family was narrated about the suffering that the soul might go through and hence to bring back the pupil some daan (donation) was sought. It is supposed that by painting the pupil the departed soul is emancipated from grief. In the consecutive scrolls, the dead man was shown happy in heaven and hence the family used to get satisfied. </div>
* <div style="text-align: justify"> The Jados would also accompany a bride to her new home, and on returning draw on a scroll a depiction of the bride’s conjugal happiness, to assure the parents their daughter was happy.</div>
* <div style="text-align: justify"> With changes in the society the painters have come along with paintings based on mythology and folklores.</div>
* <div style="text-align: justify"> Drawn with natural inks and colours like geru pathar (a red stone), sim pata (leaves of broad beans) and lamp black. The three are mixed in various ways to get different colors. Painting brush is shaped out of thin twigs.</div>
 
### Pytkar or Paitkar Painting
* <div style="text-align: justify"> The name Pytkar is derived from “Pyt” an aberration of Pata means scroll and Kar means who does this art.</div>
* <div style="text-align: justify"> The community which practices this painting has been christened as Pytkar and so is the name of the painting (Pytkar). These communities also carry the title of ‘Chitrakar’ means image maker or artist.</div>
* <div style="text-align: justify"> They live in Amadubi village of East Singhbhum dist.</div>
* <div style="text-align: justify"> These are one of the oldest tribal paintings in India and due to their appearance, they are also called scroll paintings. </div>
* <div style="text-align: justify"> Artisans from the Paitkar community use natural colour and vermillion to paint on soiled or used papers. The Paitkar artists make the palm leaves as the base of the art and the brushes are made from the hair of squirrel and goat.</div>
* <div style="text-align: justify"> The themes of the paintings almost always remain the essential existentialist question that confronts most people, what happens to a person after death. The scroll paintings are used during storytelling performances too. Stories from the epics, the Ramayana and Mahabharata, about Devi Ma, Manasa-the snake goddess, local deities all form part of the themes used by the artists. The elongated eyes, angular faces are some of the common characteristics of the paintings.</div>
 

### Chador Badoni
* <div style="text-align: justify"> A form of puppetry now limited to some rural pockets in Dumka.</div>
* <div style="text-align: justify"> Chador Badoni, which means small wooden idol, is a kind of puppet show. In this we make small wooden puppets, of both male and female figures, doing various activities, as per the need of our story and put it on a base for the show.</div>

### Sohrai Art
* <div style="text-align: justify"> The name ‘Sohrai’ is said to have derived from a paleolithic age word - ‘soro’, meaning ‘to drive with a stick’.</div>
* <div style="text-align: justify"> To welcome their winter harvest, to worship their cattle as the Goddess of wealth and to offer a thanksgiving to the forces of nature, the tribal communities (Santhal, Munda, Oraon, Prajapati, Khurmi etc.) of Jharkhand and West Bengal celebrate a festival called ‘Sohrai’ in the month of October-November. The tribal women decorate their mud houses,  repairing it after the rains, with designs of flowers, fruits, sparrows, peacocks, squirrels, cows, and various other nature-inspired designs. These wall paintings of Jharkhand are traditionally known as Sohrai, named after the namesake harvest festival.</div>
* <div style="text-align: justify"> Primarily being practised only in the district of Hazaribagh. </div>
* <div style="text-align: justify"> One of the oldest art forms of wall painting, this tribal art has continued since 10,000-4,000 BC. It is said to be following upon the similar patterns and styles once used to create ‘Isko’ and other rock arts in the region like Satpahar in Hazaribagh district.</div>
* <div style="text-align: justify"> Raw materials: The distinctive Sohrai art painted on the mud walls is a matriarchal tradition handed down from mother to daughter. These colourful paintings are done totally by using natural pigments mixed in mud — Kali matti, Charak matti, Dudhi matti, Lal matti (Geru), and Pila matti. Artists use datoon or cloth swabs daubed in different earth colours to paint on the walls — bulls, horses with riders, wild animals, trees, lotuses, peacocks, and horned deities. Sohrai paintings are considered to be good luck paintings.</div>
* <div style="text-align: justify"> Process: The wall is first coated with a layer of white mud. While the layer is still wet, they draw with their fingertips on it. The cow dung that was earlier used to cake the walls of the house is used to add colour. The dark outline is visible due to the previously applied contrasting white mud coat. The canvases range up to 12 x 18 feet. The designs are usually drawn from the artist’s memory. The personal experience of the artist, and their interaction with nature are the biggest influence.</div>
* <div style="text-align: justify"> Significance of colours: The Sohrai art painted on the mud wall is a matriarchal tradition handed down from mother to daughter. It is a symbolic-sacred artform of signs that carry multiple meanings. The house it covered with black earth representing the womb; the black earth is covered with the white earth called Dudhi (milk) representing the god and the symbols of sperm and light. When the white is covered entirely over the black earth and cut with a comb, the result is seen as a transformation of inert earth into an expression of the mother goddess.</div>
* <div style="text-align: justify"> The red line is drawn first as it represents the ‘blood of the ancestors’, procreation and fertility.</div>
* <div style="text-align: justify"> The next line is black which signifies eternal dead stone and mark of the God, Shiva.</div>
* <div style="text-align: justify"> The next all-encompassing outer lines stand in their traditional values of protection, fidelity, and chastity.</div>
* <div style="text-align: justify"> The white is painted with the last year’s rice, grounded with milk into gruel. This represents food.</div>
 
### Khovar Painting
* <div style="text-align: justify"> Khovar art was traditionally for decorating the marriage chamber of the bride and groom, and it usually depicts the animals and plants of neighbouring forests and valleys.</div>
* <div style="text-align: justify"> The name Khovar is derived from two words: kho or koh (meaning: a cave) and var (meaning: husband). Symbolizing fertility, the mural-making takes place each spring during the marriage season.</div>
* <div style="text-align: justify">The marriage season runs from January until the onset of the monsoons in June. It is in these months that Khovar designs are painted by the mother of the bride and other women of the villages as part of their traditional matrimonial ritual, where the marriage rites are performed and the newly-wed couple will sleep. This special area of the house is painted and decorated. Mothers pass on to daughters down countless generations the skills and motifs to create murals.</div>
* <div style="text-align: justify"> The base coat is usually black, the top layer white and its symbolism is sexual. The bride’s house represents the “mother”. A layer of kali mitti (dark charcoal earth) is first applied to the exterior of the mud homes and left to dry, representing the darkness of the mother’s womb. The walls are then covered with Dudhi mitti (white kaolin clay), representing the sperm of the “father”. Before this coat of light-coloured earth dries, the women use broken combs or their fingers to brush and scrape away the lighter earth, creating lyrical, black and white silhouettes with exaggerated brushstrokes. Thus symbolising fertility and breeding.</div>
* <div style="text-align: justify"> These murals are of a matriarchal tradition. </div>
* <div style="text-align: justify"> The Khovar art is full of jungle plants and animals. Even today the forest is considered by nomadic tribes the place where a couple have to go to consummate the marriage. The Khovar art is done by scraping the upper coat of white or yellow liquid earth ochre which reveals the black or red undercoat when it is scraped off with a comb.</div>
